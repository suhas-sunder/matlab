It is decided to estimate the 60 Hz voltage phasors by using sampled and digitized values of voltage observed at a transmission line terminal and Rockefeller and Udren algorithm.Â  The sampling rate used is 480 Hz.

- Determine the filters for obtaining the real and imaginary components of the voltage phasors.
- Plot the frequency response of the filters and discuss them in terms of their effectiveness for eliminating non-60Hz components.
- Implement the filters designed in part (a) to estimate the successive peak values and phase angles of a voltage signal whose digitized samples taken at 480 Hz are given below. Plot the estimates.
